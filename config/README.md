# evgen configuration

Config files are stored in the YAML format

Names for keys should be self-explanatory

Everything that's not a variant must be an integer value, constraints for which will appear here in the future

Available variants:
 - map\_variant: globe, portal
 - foliage\_variant: equator, toxic
 - mutation\_variant: random, step
 - behaviour\_variant: predestined, crazy
